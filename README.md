## Experiment Design

Title: Response to different types of stress converge in mitochondrial metabolism
The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to study 9 different stress conditions in chemostat conditions at constant specific growth rate.

|Name|Descripton|
|-|-|
|**Organism**|Saccharomyces cerevisiae|
|**RNA Sequencing**|The Illumina TruSeq sample preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, California, United States), with poly-A selection, was used to prepare RNA samples for sequencing. Fragments were clustered on cBot and sequenced on two lanes on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with paired ends (2x100bp), according to the manufacturer's instructions|
**Experiment type**|RNA-seq of coding RNA, case control design, dose response design, growth condition design, stimulus or stress design|

## Sample Information

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-4044/samples/


## Sampling Strategy

To produce small enough dataset to work on, bam files were sub sampled to 1% of their reads
~~~
#example sampling strategy
samtools view -s 0.01 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/E-MTAB-4044/E-MTAB-4044.P569_101.bam -b -o E-MTAB-4044.P569_101_1.bam

#bedtools bamToFastq to convert reads
bamToFastq -i  E-MTAB-4044.P569_101_1.bam -fq e1_R1.fq -fq2 e1_R2.fq
