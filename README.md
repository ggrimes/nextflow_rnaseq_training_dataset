## Sample Information

## Sampling Strategy

To produce small enough dataset to work on, bam files were sub sampled to 1% of their reads
~~~
#example sampling strategy
samtools view -s 0.01 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/E-MTAB-4044/E-MTAB-4044.P569_101.bam -b -o E-MTAB-4044.P569_101_1.bam

#bedtools bamToFastq to convert reads
bamToFastq -i  E-MTAB-4044.P569_101_1.bam -fq e1_R1.fq -fq2 e1_R2.fq
